# Soup Store

## Introduction

This app was created as a way to learn TypeScript while making a project that can be showcased. On the app, you are able to order cans of soup from a storefront. The company is not real, and you will not actually recieve any soup (sadly).

## How To Install

To run my app, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Once you have that taken care of, clone the repository and go into the directory.

From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/loganallengray/soup-store.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd soup-store

# Run installs
$ npm ci
```

Open another terminal window/tab and run "npm start" in the soup-store directory.

```bash
# Navigate to soup-store folder

# Start the app
$ npm start
```
